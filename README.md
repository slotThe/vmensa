# vmensa
Very simple program to connect to the [openmensa
api](https://doc.openmensa.org/api/v2/), fetch a couple of different canteens,
filter the results according to the authors dietary requirements, and print out
the relevant meals to stdout.

# Building
Build with `stack build`, then copy the executable to a convenient location.
