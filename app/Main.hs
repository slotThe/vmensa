{- Note [Async]
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here, we concurrently connect to the API, parse the necessary JSON and
then create some pretty-printed text for each canteen.

The function @mapConcurrently@ creates a thread for every canteen, which
would normally be a fire hazard and may cause your laptop to melt
through your desk.  However, since the list of all canteens is rather
small (even trying to show __everything__ there is would only be around
20 network connections), it was deemed "worth it" in this case.
